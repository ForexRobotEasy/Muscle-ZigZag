Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We only provide this code as a demonstration of how the Muscle ZigZag indicator can work.

## Requirements
- This code requires the inclusion of the `Trade.mqh` library.

## Global Variables
- `ZigZagBuffer[]`: Stores the calculated ZigZag values.
- `MovingAverageBuffer[]`: Stores the calculated Moving Average values.

## Initialization
The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the Muscle ZigZag indicator and the Moving Average lines. It sets the necessary indicator properties and resizes the buffers.

## Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit()` function is responsible for cleaning up the ZigZag and Moving Average buffers.

## Main Entry Point
The `OnStart()` function is the main entry point of the code. It calls the `CalcZigZag()` and `CalcMovingAverage()` functions to calculate the ZigZag and Moving Average values respectively. Then, it generates trading signals using the `GenerateTradingSignals()` function and executes trades based on these signals using the `ExecuteTrades()` function.

## Calculation of ZigZag
The `CalcZigZag()` function is where the ZigZag calculation logic should be implemented. The calculated ZigZag values should be stored in the `ZigZagBuffer`.

## Calculation of Moving Average
The `CalcMovingAverage()` function is where the Moving Average calculation logic should be implemented. The calculated Moving Average values should be stored in the `MovingAverageBuffer`.

## Generation of Trading Signals
The `GenerateTradingSignals()` function is where the trading signal generation logic should be implemented.

## Execution of Trades
The `ExecuteTrades()` function is where the trade execution logic should be implemented.
